## Introduction

#### A lot of people like to get into the sea water. Some to get away from the heat of a hot summer day, others to practice a sport, or simply to feel the sea. But, although, in general, there should be no danger to take a dip in the water, we must know that in the sea live many animals and plants, and in some cases, they can come dangerously close to the bathing areas. This is the case of sharks.
#### But, do these attacks continue to occur over the years, or are there safety measures that make them less frequent? In which countries are you more likely to suffer a shark attack? With what activity are you most at risk?
#### We will try to answer these questions with the analysis of the following DataFrame.

## DataFrame


#### This is the [DataFrame](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks)


## Hipothesys
#### Let's consider three hypotheses:
#### 1. Shark attacks have decreased in the last 20 years.
#### 2. Shark attacks occur more in the summer months.
#### 3. Surfing is the activity where most attacks occur.

## Libraries

#### Pandas
#### Numpy
#### Regex
#### Matplotlib
#### Seaborn
